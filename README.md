This repository is created for me to develope code for scraping twitter escpecially for my final project on digital forensic research  in Telkom University.

My final project title is "social media scraping on data acquisition for digital forensic"

this research is meant for suggesting to use scraping method on social media for data acquisition in digital forensic world

as reference, all of these code i got from this website

https://www.promptcloud.com/blog/scrape-twitter-data-using-python-r/

As what on the website tutorials, i'm using
1. Jupyter notebook as my intepreter
2. Tweepy as library for accessing twitter API
3. Windows 10 as my host OS
4. Python 3.7

Currently i'm on progress to figuring out how to scrap and save it as CSV file or Excel File from: 

1. tweets that contain english alphabet
2. tweets that contain non-english alphabets (chinese character, russian alphabet,etc)
3. tweets that contain emoji or emoticon 
3. tweets that contain links 
4. tweets that contain image from multiple format of image (JPG,JPEG,GIF,PNG) since only this image format allowed to be input to twitter
5. tweets that contain video (MP4 and MOV format)

for this research i hopefully anyone that are expert on scraping using python could contribute to help me developing this code further,
even a little bit of contribution is really appreciated. 
Thank you
